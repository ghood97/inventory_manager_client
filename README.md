<h3>Planning</h3>

I began this project by building the GUI in HTML and SASS. Then I built the user authentication forms for sign-up/in/out and change password. After authenticaion was verified as working I built the table configuration for display products and inventory. My main goal for this project was to keep the HTML and CSS/SASS organized and efficient. I used Bootstrap to keep the layout response and simple. My main strategizing was done during the process of display items in the table. I first built curl scripts to test my request format before implementing it in the application itself.


<h3>Future Versions</h3>

As I havent run into any unsolved problems, I would like to refactor the HTML to use 2 different tables for inventory and products instead of using just one table and telling the application which items to display andn when.
